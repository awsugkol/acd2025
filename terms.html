            <h3>1. Event.</h3>
            <p>
              You may only register for and attend the Event in accordance with these Terms. To register for the Event, you must
              complete the Event registration process and pay any registration fee. Unless the Event’s registration webpage specifies
              otherwise or we expressly inform you otherwise, you must be at least 18 years of age on the first day of the Event.
              Event registration is subject to availability and may close earlier than the posted deadline, as determined in our sole
              discretion. We may also change the Event program at any time in our sole discretion. You will at all times comply with
              the <a href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Safety and Security.</h3>
            <p>Your safety and security is important to us. You understand that you and your property may be subject to a reasonable
            search upon entry to the Event and you may be asked to provide photo identification. If you refuse to participate in
            these security measures, we may deny you entry. We also reserve the right to ask you to leave the Event if your behavior
            causes us concern for the safety or security of Event attendees. If we deny you entry or require you to leave, you will
            not receive a refund.</p>

            <h3>3. Your Information.</h3>

            <p><b>3.2 Sharing with Event Sponsors.</b> We may provide your contact information to Event Sponsors if (a) you elect to attend
            any sessions or other activities at the Event involving Event Sponsors (in which case we would provide your contact
            information only to the Event Sponsor involved in such session or other activity,) or (b) you opt in during registration
            or otherwise to receive communications from our Event Sponsors.</p>
            <p><b>3.3 Voice and Image.</b> By participating in the Event experiences, you agree that we may derive information from recordings
            of your voice and images of your face and retain and use all resulting information, in each case in accordance with the
            AWS Privacy Notice.</p>


            <h3>4. Recordings and Your Materials.</h3>
            <p>You grant us, our affiliates, and our independent contractors the right to record, film, photograph, and capture your
            voice and image in any media at the Event (the “Recordings”). You grant to AWS and its affiliates, agents, employees,
            and assigns an irrevocable, nonexclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce,
            modify, distribute, and translate, for any purpose relating to our business, all or any part of the Recordings and Your
            Materials. We may edit the Recordings and Your Materials, use them alone or together with other information, and allow
            others to use and disseminate them. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you waive any moral rights you may have in
            the Recordings and Your Materials. You represent and warrant that (a) Your Materials are true and accurate to the best
            of your knowledge, (b) you have the necessary rights and permissions to grant the license in this Section 4, and (c)
            Your Materials do not violate or infringe any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.</p>

            <h3>5. Cancellation.</h3>
            <p><b>5.1 By You.</b> If registration fees or other fees are required for the Event, cancellation instructions and the Event’s
            refund policy will be listed on the Event’s registration webpage.</p>
            <p><b>5.2 By Us.</b> We may cancel the Event at any time for reasons including, for example, availability or suitability of venue
            or speakers or on security, health, or safety grounds, and we may deny, limit, or cancel your Event registration at any
            time. We are not responsible for any damages, direct or indirect, resulting from such cancellation. If we cancel the
            Event or your registration and you are in compliance with these Terms, we will issue you a refund of your Event
            registration fee in accordance with the refund policy on the Event’s registration webpage.</p>
